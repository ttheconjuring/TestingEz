# TestingEz
Web application that aims to provide an easy and intuitive way for people to craete and participate in tests with instant result feedback.

- Utilized a hybrid architecture that combines a traditional monolithic pattern with a service-oriented approach. One service fetches data from an external API, stores it in the database, and provides it to the main service, demonstrating REST communication between services.
- Built a secure application with session-based authentication and authorization.
- Developed the front end entirely using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap and Thymeleaf (Server-Side Rendering).
- Implemented caching and schedulers for periodic database updates.
- Added global error handling and custom error messages.
- Included internationalization with support for many languages.
- Tested by unit and integration tests to ensure functionality and stability of the system.
